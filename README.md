# GPSystemAirports
Besic GPS System for Airports

GPSystemAirports is an advanced C++ project designed to calculate the distances between airports around the globe, leveraging geographical coordinates. Developed with the essence of modern software automation and the rich features of the C++ Standard Library, this project offers a deep dive into the practical application of latitude and longitude in determining air travel distances.

# Background
In an age where paper maps have been largely replaced by digital navigation and GPS systems, the ability to accurately calculate distances and navigate efficiently has become paramount. This project encapsulates the essence of such advancements, focusing on air travel where the complexity of navigation requires precise calculations and adherence to regulatory airspace boundaries.

# Geographical Coordinates: Utilizes the latitude and longitude of airports to pinpoint precise locations on the Earth's surface.
Distance Calculation: Implements mathematical formulas to calculate the shortest distance between any two given points, accounting for the Earth's curvature.

# Airspace Regulations: Acknowledges the need to consider airspace restrictions and regulations in route planning (note: this version may not include real-time airspace regulation data).
C++ Standard Library Utilization: Leverages various functionalities of the C++ Standard Library for efficient data handling and computations.
Modular Design: Structured with multiple source and header files for clarity, maintainability, and ease of integration into larger systems.
